# Kiwi Flash: A Digital Bridge to New Zealand's Natural Heritage

**[➡️ Live Demo: Explore Kiwi Flash Here](https://mara-cutas.github.io/Kiwi-Flash/)**

## Project Vision

As a passionate advocate for wildlife conservation, I've always been driven by a deep curiosity about the natural world. This project, Kiwi Flash, was born from a personal desire to deepen my own knowledge of New Zealand's unique and precious flora and fauna. It's a simple, interactive flashcard application designed to make learning about these species both engaging and accessible.

## Bridging Technology and Conservation

Beyond being a personal learning tool, this project serves a greater purpose: to demonstrate my ability to rapidly learn and apply new technologies to the field of conservation. In a world where digital outreach and education are increasingly vital, our ability to leverage modern tools is paramount.

This application was conceived and built in just a few days, a testament to the power of modern development platforms. It was developed using **[Firebase Studio](https://studio.firebase.google.com/)**, an AI-assisted development environment that accelerates the process of building and deploying web applications. By handling much of the boilerplate code and infrastructure, Firebase Studio allowed me to focus on what truly mattered: creating a useful and enjoyable experience for learning about conservation.

My message to fellow conservationists is this: the technological barrier to creating impactful digital tools is lower than ever. We can build and share our knowledge in new and exciting ways, fostering a wider appreciation for the species we strive to protect.

## Features

*   **Interactive Flashcards:** Browse through 50 cards featuring New Zealand's native birds, insects, trees, and marine life.
*   **Fact Reveal:** Flip the card to reveal the species' name and 3-5 interesting facts.
*   **Multiple Images:** See different views of a species on cards that feature more than one photo.
*   **Further Learning:** A "Learn More" button on each card takes you directly to a Google search to encourage deeper exploration.
*   **Responsive Design:** Fully accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.

Thank you for visiting my project. I hope it inspires you to consider how we can further merge the worlds of technology and conservation.
